Afterlight Tribute
--------

Afterlight Tribute is a monochromatic blog theme with an option for a full-screen background image. Add your favorite background image or color to lend your personal flair. It is a basic, black and white, simple blank canvas theme using:

- integration with Pure CSS by Yahoo! for more mobile friendly page elements
- default Backdrop layouts
- some Bartik default CSS
- a single CSS file OR
- SASS stylesheets using libSASS and Grunt for workflow
- Responsive Menus module integration is highly recommended.
- integration with either the Mobile Navigation module or Responsive Menus module for dropdown or mobile-friendly main menu.  Sliders, custom fonts and other theme features do not come with this and you are encouraged to incorporate separate modules for each page feature that you wish.

A blog or organization that wishes to be seen as stylish is a good example of how to use this theme.
A traditional/blue-chip type business is probably not a good fit for this theme.

"This theme differentiates itself by its simplicity and structure. It does not incorporate a great list of features but rather embodies a frontend workflow. Many of the existing themes are bloated with features and overwrites. We do not want to rewrite output, just makes it easier to develop a theme in a structured way." - quote from the original developers.

TESTED
-----

@todo
This theme has been manually tested successfully creating and viewing nodes and style guide in Backdrop with the Mobile Navigation, Webform and Responsive Menus modules.

KNOWN ISSUES
---------------------

NOTE -- this theme is somewhat stable but being developed state.  If you have spare time and shared ideas on how to propel it forward coding cleanly and under the appropriate licenses, you are welcome to join in and offer advice or build it together.

This theme works as is by just installing it.

If it bothers you that we don't use the Libraries module, file an issue and we can try to change it.

When official information on using third-party frameworks becomes known, this will follow it.

The first big change we will make to this theme when we have time is to run this theme through an "un-css" cleaner and chop out some css (even core) to make this download faster.  A major goal of this theme is to download your pages fast to the end user.

@todo

INSTALLATION
------------
- download and install this theme per usual Backdrop themes: <https://backdropcms.org/guide/themes>
- to see how this theme handles all the page elements, use this module <https://github.com/backdrop-contrib/styleguide>

COMING FROM DRUPAL?
-------------------

If you are using Backdrop and have a previous knowledge of Drupal, you will notice that Drupal themes spend a lot of template files and CSS arranging things on the page where this theme doesn't so much.  This theme is more of a style guide of how page elements are supposed to look and not much layout.  It relies on the layouts module.

This theme does not use the PureCSS grid by default.  It uses the default layouts module until layouts in Backdrop become more defined.

CASUAL USAGE
------------------

If you would like to use CSS instead of SASS, edit the css/style.css file to alter the appearence of your website.
Place your custom CSS at the bottom of the file.

If you would like to add custom Javascript to your site, edit the js/scripts.js file.

ADVANCED USAGE
------------------

FILE STRUCTURE
------------------

Overall file structure

- The .info file is for the listing of files to incorporate into your theme.
- The color folder is for the Color module UI.  Probably not important to alter.
- The CSS folder contains the style.css file you should use, which is the file that gets loaded on every page.  It gets overriden by SASS if you use SASS.
- The JS folder contains the scripts.js file you should use, which is the file that gets loaded on every page.
- The images folder is for your images and icons.
- The SASS folder is for your SASS CSS partials.
- Template.php contains PHP functions that alter the HTML of your Backdrop site.
- config.rb contains settings if you are using SASS Compass
- Gruntfile.js and package.json contain settings if you are using SASS Grunt

SASS file structure

We are in the process of converting from random code from different places into follwowing:
<http://www.sitepoint.com/architecture-sass-project/>
<http://sass-guidelin.es/>

USAGE
